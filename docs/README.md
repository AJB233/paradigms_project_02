# CS4337 Project 2 – Prolog Maze Solver

This project implements the predicate:

find_exit(+Maze, ?Actions)


It determines whether a sequence of actions leads from the start `s` to an exit `e` in a maze represented as a list of lists.

## Structure

- `src/project2.pl` — implementation.
- `src/example.pl` — sample mazes and display predicates.
- `src/test.pl` — random maze generator.
- `test/sample-run.txt` — expected test output.
- `docs/` — documentation and devlog.

Instructions will be updated as project progresses.
